# UniFun: University Event Management Mobile Application - Software Engineering Project

## Project Overview

The UniFun project is a comprehensive software engineering endeavor focused on developing a mobile application to centralize information about festivals and social events at King Saud University (KSU). This application aims to provide students with a convenient and unified platform to discover and stay updated on campus activities, thereby fostering a more connected and engaged university community. This project addresses the challenge of fragmented event information, which often leads to reduced student engagement and missed opportunities.

### Key Objectives:
* Provide an intuitive interface for discovering university events.
* Enable students to seamlessly integrate events into their personal calendars.
* Offer robust filtering capabilities for events based on user interests.
* Present comprehensive and detailed information for each event.

## Domain Analysis

This project operates within the domain of University Event Management. The domain analysis identified the critical need to enhance student engagement at King Saud University by consolidating event information. The analysis involved understanding the current landscape of event dissemination and the challenges faced by students in accessing timely and relevant information.

### Key Terminology:
* **Event:** A scheduled activity or gathering organized for students (e.g., workshops, cultural events).
* **User Profile:** A personalized account tracking student preferences, interests, and event participation history.
* **Event Feed:** A dynamic list of upcoming events displayed based on student interests.
* **Club:** An official student group focused on specific activities.
* **Calendar:** A personalized tool for students to add, delete, and edit events, providing an overview of campus activities.

### System Users:
The primary users of the UniFun application are **students** at King Saud University. User profiles and technical competencies were considered during the design phase to ensure ease of use.

## Requirements Engineering

The requirements for UniFun were meticulously gathered using a combination of user interviews with key stakeholders (Head of Student Activities, club presidents) and questionnaires distributed to 22 students. This phase was crucial for understanding user needs and pain points related to event discovery and participation.

### Key Findings & Features:
* **Problem:** Information fragmentation across various platforms was a major issue.
* **Preferred Sources:** Social media (Instagram, X/Twitter) are dominant.
* **Desired Features:** High demand for personalized event recommendations, event notifications, calendar synchronization, and advanced event filtering.
* **Adoption Likelihood:** High willingness to adopt a centralized app, with ease of use being paramount.

## System Design

The system design phase outlines the architectural blueprint and detailed components of the UniFun application.

## Live Preview
You can view a preview of the app's design created with FlutterFlow here: https://app.flutterflow.io/share/unifun-f9sstn?page=page0

Please note that some features may not be fully functional as this preview is not connected to Firebase yet.

### Key Design Elements:
* **System Architecture:** Defines the overall structure and interaction between different system components.
* **Class Diagram:** Illustrates the classes, attributes, operations, and relationships within the system's object-oriented structure.
* **Data Design:** Specifies the database schema, including entities like `Users`, `Events`, `Clubs`, and `UserEvent`, along with their attributes, data types, and constraints.
* **Component Design:** Details the functionality of various system components through user stories, pseudocode, and design specifications for features such as adding, editing, deleting, and searching events.
* **Interface Design:** Describes the application's user interface structure via a navigation diagram and provides illustrative screenshots with field descriptions. Five core UX standards were integrated to ensure a user-friendly experience.

## Implementation & Testing

This section covers the development and quality assurance processes for the UniFun application. Rigorous testing phases were conducted to ensure the system meets its requirements and performs reliably.

### Testing Phases:
* **User Story Acceptance Testing:** Verification of individual user stories.
* **Integration Testing:** Testing the interactions between different modules and components.
* **User Acceptance Testing (UAT):** Conducted with 10 participants to evaluate the app's usability and effectiveness in real-world scenarios. UAT covered core functionalities like sign-up, login, event Browse, calendar integration, searching, and logout. Feedback was collected via questionnaires.
